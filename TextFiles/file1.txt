Metroid Prime is a video game developed by Retro Studios and Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube, 
released in North America in 2002 and in Japan and Europe the following year. 
It is the first 3D game in the Metroid series, the fifth main installment, and is classified by 
Nintendo as a first-person adventure rather than a first-person shooter, due to the large exploration 
component of the game and its precedence over combat. Like previous games in the series, Metroid Prime 
has a science fiction setting, in which players control the bounty hunter Samus Aran. The story follows 
Samus as she battles the Space Pirates and their biological experiments on the planet Tallon IV. The 
game was a collaborative effort between Retro's staff in Austin, Texas, and Japanese Nintendo employees, 
including producer Shigeru Miyamoto, who was the one who suggested the project after visiting Retro's headquarters 
in 2000. Despite initial backlash from fans due to the first-person perspective, the game was released 
to both universal acclaim and commercial success, selling more than a million units in North America alone.
