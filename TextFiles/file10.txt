An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides 
common services for computer programs. The operating system is a vital component of the system software in a computer system. 
Application programs require an operating system to function.

Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include 
accounting for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.

For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an 
intermediary between programs and the computer hardware,[1][2] although the application code is usually 
executed directly by the hardware and will frequently make a system call to an OS function or be interrupted by it. 
Operating systems can be found on almost any device that contains a computerâ€”from cellular phones and video game consoles to supercomputers and web servers.
