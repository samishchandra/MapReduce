A video game is an electronic game that involves human interaction with a user interface to 
generate visual feedback on a video device. The word video in video game traditionally 
referred to a cathode ray tube (CRT) display device,[1] but it now implies any type of 
display device that can produce two or three dimensional images. The electronic systems used 
to play video games are known as platforms; examples of these are personal computers and 
video game consoles. These platforms range from large mainframe computers to small handheld devices. 
Specialized video games such as arcade games, while previously common, have gradually declined in use. 
Video games have gone on to become an art form and industry.
