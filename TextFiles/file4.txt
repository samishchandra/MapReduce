The first argument is a string containing the filename. The second argument is another 
string containing a few characters describing the way in which the file will be used. 
mode can be 'r' when the file will only be read, 'w' for only writing (an existing file 
with the same name will be erased), and 'a' opens the file for appending; any data written 
to the file is automatically added to the end. 'r+' opens the file for both reading and writing. 
The mode argument is optional; 'r' will be assumed if itâ€™s omitted.
