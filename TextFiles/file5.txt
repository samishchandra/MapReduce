The pickle module keeps track of the objects it has already serialized, so that 
later references to the same object wonâ€™t be serialized again. marshal doesn't do this.

This has implications both for recursive objects and object sharing. Recursive objects 
are objects that contain references to themselves. These are not handled by marshal, 
and in fact, attempting to marshal recursive objects will crash your Python interpreter. 
Object sharing happens when there are multiple references to the same object in different 
places in the object hierarchy being serialized. pickle stores such objects only once, 
and ensures that all other references point to the master copy. Shared objects remain shared, 
which can be very important for mutable objects.
