Luke P. Blackburn (1816â€“1887) was a physician, philanthropist and politician from Kentucky. 
Early in his career, he gained national fame for effecting the first successful quarantine against 
yellow fever in the Mississippi River valley and was regarded as an expert on the disease. 
During the Civil War, he aided Confederate blockade runners in Canada and traveled to Bermuda 
to combat a yellow fever outbreak threatening Confederate blockade-running operations. A Confederate 
double agent accused him of collecting linens and garments used by the yellow fever patients and 
smuggling them into the North to start a yellow fever epidemic to hamper the Union war effort.
