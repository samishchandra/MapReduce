Intelligence has been defined in many different ways including, but not limited to, 
abstract thought, understanding, self-awareness, communication, reasoning, learning, 
having emotional knowledge, retaining, planning, and problem solving.

Intelligence is most widely studied in humans, but has also been observed in animals 
and in plants. Artificial intelligence is the simulation of intelligence in machines.

Within the discipline of psychology, various approaches to human intelligence have been adopted. 
The psychometric approach is especially familiar to the general public, as well as being the most researched and by far the most widely used in practical settings.
