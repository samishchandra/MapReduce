In logic, a consistent theory is one that does not contain a contradiction.[1] 
The lack of contradiction can be defined in either semantic or syntactic terms. 
The semantic definition states that a theory is consistent if and only if it has a model, 
i.e. there exists an interpretation under which all formulas in the theory are true. 
This is the sense used in traditional Aristotelian logic, although in contemporary 
mathematical logic the term satisfiable is used instead. The syntactic definition states that 
a theory is consistent if and only if there is no formula P such that both P and its negation are provable from the 
axioms of the theory under its associated deductive system.

If these semantic and syntactic definitions are equivalent for a particular logic, the logic is complete.

[clarification needed][citation needed] The completeness of sentential calculus was proved by 
Paul Bernays in 1918[citation needed][2] and Emil Post in 1921,[3] while the completeness of predicate calculus 
was proved by Kurt GÃ¶del in 1930,[4] and consistency proofs for arithmetics restricted with respect to the induction 
axiom schema were proved by Ackermann (1924), von Neumann (1927) and Herbrand (1931).[5] 
Stronger logics, such as second-order logic, are not complete.
